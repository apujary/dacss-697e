This final project for Social Network Analysis (DACSS 697E) analyzes two YouTube video networks generated from select keywords from the
Indian right-wing vocabulary to examine whether the platform's algorithm has a role in constructing echo chambers, leading to user
radicalization. Data for this project were collected from the 'YouTube Data Tools' website on May 11th and 18th.
